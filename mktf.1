.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The mktf command launches an Ubuntu instance, installs Terraform, and creates Terraform scripts for the Google Cloud provider, regional providers, and a backend on Google Cloud Storage\. The goal of this command is to make getting started with Terraform easier\. To support all of this, mktf also creates a service account with the appropriate IAM permissions and a version\-enabled Google Cloud Storage bucket\.
.
.P
The Terraform code is stored in /usr/local/etc/tf\. To use the code, copy all the files to your source directory, make any desired changes, and run "terraform init"\. The goal of mktf is to automate the standard setup stuff\. You still need to have a working knowledge of Terraform\.
.
.P
In addition to installing Terraform and creating initial terraform scripts, mktf also modifies the global bashrc file to (1) display a message saying the Terraform source files are in /usr/local/etc/tf and (2) copies /usr/local/etc/vim/vimrc to ~/\.vimrc if ~/\.vimrc does not exist\. This last item was added to simplify the creation of ~/\.vimrc since the behavior of vim configuration files may vary between releases\.
